						images.</u>

			<i> HTML is considered one of the three essential tools in webpage
				creation: HTML provides the structure or the way text, pictures, and so on
				will appear on the website. CSS (cascading style sheets) sets the visual
				properties of these elements, such as colors, format, and layout.
				Meanwhile, Javascript makes these elements behave in certain ways
				depending on a user's action. For example, the font size of text can
				increase when users hover their mouse or click a button on a page.</i>

			<span>To write HTML, you'll need a text editor, like Notepad, Brackets, or
				Atom. HTML editors make sure your coding is clean and functional. They
				help reduce errors by automatically inserting tags (auto-completion) and
				other common elements or through debugging.

			What's HTML Used For?
			HTML is the default language of websites and web-based documents. It helps
			a browser understand the structure and style of a document or files for
			viewing over the internet. It allows your web pages to host audio, videos,
			spreadsheets, and other applications. It also facilitates navigation within
			web pages or between websites through hypertext.

			Moreover, website makers can use HTML to design forms for ordering
			products, making reservations, or searching for information. HTML is,
			therefore, the basic building block for building your brand and running an
			e-commerce site or an online subscription-based business.

			What Makes Up an HTML Document?
			The primary components of an HTML document are tags and elements. They tell
			your browser how to display your content. Tags start and end with angled
			brackets or the "less than" and "greater than" signs. Letters between them
			are called element contents.
